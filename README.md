Dredd Transactions library compiles *HTTP Transactions* (simple Request-Response pairs) from API description document.

> **Note:** To better understand *emphasized* terms in this documentation, please refer to the [Glossary of Terms][api-blueprint-glossary]. All data structures are described using the [MSON][mson-spec] format.


## Work in Progress Notice

This project supersedes [Blueprint Transactions][blueprint-transactions] library. However, it is not ready yet nor used in [Dredd][dredd] and nobody is advised to consider this project as something to use in production environment as of now.


## Features

* Inherits parameters from parent *Resource* and *Action* sections.
* Expands *URI Templates*.
* Warns on undefined placeholders in *URI Templates* (both query and path).
* Validates URI parameter types.
* Selects first *Request* and first *Response* if multiple are specified in the API description document.


### Deprecated Features

* Compiles [Transaction Name][transaction-object-spec] string (vague identifier) for each *Transaction*.
* Provides [Transaction Origin][transaction-object-spec] with pointers to [API Elements][api-elements] derived from the original API description document.

> **Note:** These features are to be superseded by so-called _Transaction Path_. Feel free to read and comment the proposal in [apiaryio/dredd#227](https://github.com/apiaryio/dredd/issues/227).


## Installation

```
npm install dredd-transactions
```


## Development

Dredd Transactions library is written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) language which compiles to JavaScript (ECMAScript 5).


## Usage

### `compile`

Compiles *HTTP Transactions* from given API description document.

```javascript
var dt = require('dredd-transactions');

dt.compile('# My API\n...', 'apiary.apib', function (error, compilationResult) {
  // ...
});
```

### Arguments

- (string) - API description document provided as string.
- (string) - Original file name of the API description document. **Soon to be removed! See [#6][filename-deprecation].**
- (function) - Callback.

### Callback Arguments

- (enum[null, object]) - Standard JavaScript error object.
- ([Compilation Result][compilation-result-object-spec])


## Data Structures

<a name="compilation-result-object"></a>
### Compilation Result (object)

Result of compilation. Alongside compiled [Transaction][transaction-object-spec] objects contains also errors and warnings, mainly from API description parser.

- `transactions` (array[[Transaction][transaction-object-spec]]) - Compiled _HTTP Transactions_.
- `annotations` (array[[Annotation][annotation-object-spec]]) - Errors and warnings which occurred during parsing of the API description or during compilation of transactions.

<a name="transaction-object"></a>
### Transaction (object)

Represents a single *HTTP Transaction* (Request-Response pair) and its location in the API description document. The location is provided in two forms, both **deprecated** as of now:

- `name` - String representation, both human- and machine-readable.
- `origin` - Object of references to nodes of [API Elements][api-elements] derived from the original API description document.

> **Note:** These two forms of locating HTTP Transactions are to be superseded by so-called _Transaction Path_. Feel free to read and comment the proposal in [apiaryio/dredd#227](https://github.com/apiaryio/dredd/issues/227).


### Properties

- request (object) - HTTP Request as described in API description document.
    - method
    - uri: `/message` (string) - Informative URI of the Request.
    - headers (object)
    - body: `Hello world!\n` (string)
- response (object) - Expected HTTP Response as described in API description document.
    - status: `200` (string)
    - headers (object)
    - body (string)
    - schema (string)


### Deprecated Properties

- name: `Hello world! > Retrieve Message` (string) - Transaction Name, non-deterministic breadcrumb location of the HTTP Transaction within the API description document.
- origin (object) - Object of references to nodes of [API Elements][api-elements] derived from the original API description document.
    - filename: `./blueprint.md` (string)
    - apiName: `My Api` (string)
    - resourceGroupName: `Greetings` (string)
    - resourceName: `Hello, world!` (string)
    - actionName: `Retrieve Message` (string)
    - exampleName: `First example` (string)

> **Note:** These properties are to be superseded by so-called _Transaction Path_. Feel free to read and comment the proposal in [apiaryio/dredd#227](https://github.com/apiaryio/dredd/issues/227).


<a name="annotation-object"></a>
### Annotation (object)

Description of an error or warning which occurred during parsing of the API description or during compilation of transactions.

#### Properties

- type (enum[string]) - Type of the annotation.
    - `error`
    - `warning`
- component (enum[string]) - In which component of the compilation process the annotation occurred.
    - `apiDescriptionParser`
    - `parametersValidation`
    - `uriTemplateExpansion`
- code (number) - Parser-specific code of the annotation.
- message (string) - Textual annotation. This is – in most cases – a human-readable message to be displayed to user.
- location (array) - Locations of the annotation in the source file. A series of character-blocks, which may be non-continuous. For further details refer to API Elements' [Source Map](source-map) element.
    - (array, fixed) - Continuous characters block. A pair of character index and character count.
        - (number) - Zero-based index of a character in the source document.
        - (number) - Count of characters starting from the character index.

### Deprecated Properties

- origin (object) - Object of references to nodes of [API Elements][api-elements] derived from the original API description document.
    - filename: `./blueprint.md` (string)
    - apiName: `My Api` (string)
    - resourceGroupName: `Greetings` (string)
    - resourceName: `Hello, world!` (string)
    - actionName: `Retrieve Message` (string)
    - exampleName: `First example` (string)
